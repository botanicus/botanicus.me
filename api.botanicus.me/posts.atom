    <summary>I love wearing suits. These days I basically don't wear anything else.
  Unfortunately suits got bad rep these days. They've been accused of being
  "uncomfortable", "too corporate" and "stuffy". To me nothing could be more
  far from the truth.</summary>

      <h2>A suit is man's purse</h2>
<p>
  I don't like wearing bags. I never did, but before I started to wear suits,
  I simply had to. There is only so much you can fit into tiny jeans pockets.
</p>
<!-- This depends on high-waisted trousers, English-fit. -->

<p>
  With a suit, there is space for everything. Documents, map, money, debit card,
  hankerchief, pen, pocket knife, keys ... I sometimes even put my iPad mini into
  my pocket and no one could tell from the outside.
</p>

<p>
  I like to get a <strong>fob pocket</strong> fitted into my trousers. With a fob
  pocket, it's simply impossible to lose keys, ever.
</p>

<h2>Comfort</h2>
<!-- braces, high waist -->

<h2>The "too-stuffy" myth</h2>
<p>
  Really
</p>

<p>
  Wool keeps you warm when it's cold and keeps you cool when it's hot.
  I always thought this is a bullshit.
  <!-- also consider: aircon (public transport), buttoning up a jacket -->
</p>

<p>
  <!-- trousers fit -->
</p>

<h2>The look</h2>
<p>
  I'm a rather skinny guy. A good suit makes me look more muscular. Save your
  gym membership. What's not to like about that?
</p>

<h2>Suits and dancing</h2>

<h2>Suits make pick-pocketting hard</h2>

<!-- I always look presentable, no need to think hard what to wear and this doesn't go with that ... -->
