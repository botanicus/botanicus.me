title: "How I procrastinate: planning"

Procrastinating by planning is very similar in nature to procrastinating by [researching stuff](https://medium.com/@botanicus/how-i-procrastinate-research-ba395aad4371). We usually have to do *some* planning, but doing too much of it is just an excuse to waste time.

One kind of procrastinating by planning is **planning the future too much**. There is a handful of things in life that's a good to have an idea about (such as having or not having kids, having some kind of financial or material security), but stuff like "I want my business to grow 50% by August 2017" is just an intellectual wanking and a bloody waste of time.

It is motivated by our fear of uncertainty.

Then other examples like "I want to visit countries X Y Z and learn Spanish, harpooning sharks and cooking with my only left hand" are motivated by fear of missing out.

Based on my experience, our destiny has very little interest in what we have planned it to be.

Too bad. I could've been the king of universe with all the things I planned to learn by now.

Before I get angry letters and before people start to attacking me by their piles of new years resolutions â€“ I do not advocate mediocrity. Oh no. No, no, no. Not that one.

This is about letting the future go, so we can be truly present in ... the present. (I might work on my writing skills ... in the future ... ehhm.) I heard this about milion bloody times and I albeit I intellectually understood it, I was just unable to do it (and, of course, unaware of my inability of thereof).

And so this is our best shot on being able to do all that cool stuff we were planning: to let it go, be here and now and not discount the present moment. Because those present moments create the future.
