<p id="excerpt">
  Only recently I realised how bad internet addiction is.
  Having a device connected to the internet at your fingertips
  is like having a bottle of vodka by your bed.
</p>

<p>
  I open my laptop and the WiFi is disabled.
  When I try to turn it on, it switches itself off in a few seconds.
</p>

<p>
  That is unless I'm within hours I allowed myself to be online (between 9:30 and 18:20)
  and unless I specifically say "I'm going online for X minutes to do task Y".
</p>

<p>
  And why on Earth am I doing that? Well, did it every happen to you that you woke up,
  went on Facebook, chatted with some friends, read your newsfeed, read some articles,
  watched a few videos and whops, suddenly it was time for dinner?
</p>

<p>
  Yep. So that's why.
</p>

<p>
  Free internet is same as free booze â€“ not healthy.

  The good news is I made <a href="https://github.com/botanicus/internet-usage-limitter">this project</a> publicly available.
  The bad news is you have to be a programmer in order to be able use it.
  However if there's enough interest, I might consider making it a real program that anyone can use.
