title: "MOC: music on console on OS X"

<p id="excerpt">
  I don't know why, but all the music players around are just so unnecessarily
  bloated with features I don't need. All I want is file explorer that can play
  media files, treating directories like playlists.
</p>

<h2>Installation and basic setup</h2>
<code>brew install moc</code>

<p>
  MOC needs coreaudio running. After a while I got sick running <code>cd /tmp;
  nohup jackd -d coreaudio &amp;; cd -</code> and wrote a simple <a href="http://www.launchd.info/">launchd script</a>
  that launches coreaudio on startup.
</p>

<code lang="xml">
launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/$USER.coreaudio.launch.plist
tee ~/Library/LaunchAgents/$USER.coreaudio.launch.plist <<EOF

<h2>Notifications</h2>
<code lang="ruby" file="~/.moc/on_song_change.rb">
#!/usr/bin/env ruby

artist, album, song, filename, duration = ARGV

artist ||= filename.split('/')[-3]
album  ||= filename.split('/')[-2]
song   ||= filename.split('/')[-1].sub(/\.[^.]+$/, '')

title = "#{song} [#{duration}]"
body = "#{album} by #{artist}"

exec <<-SCRIPT
  osascript -e "display notification \\"#{body}\\" with title \\"#{title}\\""
SCRIPT
</code>

<code lang="xml" file="~/.moc/config">
Theme = nightly_theme
OnSongChange = "/Users/botanicus/.moc/on_song_change.rb %a %r %t %f %d"

<h2>OS X media keys</h2>
<p>
  <i>Unresolved.</i>
</p>

<p style="font-style: italic">
  There's also <a href="https://cmus.github.io/">Cmus</a> which seems to be more
  actively developped and doesn't need work-arounds to work on OS X. It has plugins
  for integrating with OS X notifications, media keys and so on. The interface
  doesn't suit me though.
