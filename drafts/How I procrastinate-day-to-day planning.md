How we procrastinate: day-to-day planning

// too much in detail. Probably similar motivation, this has a profound impact on our (un)ability to be in the moment.

Without wanting to sound like full of “empowerment” bullshit, I have to say I see fear of some kind being the main motivation.

Some people over-plan the future, I think it’s mostly fear of uncertainty. At least this one was yours truly mostly sparred.

Over-planning I tend to do though is on day-to-day level.

The problem is I want to do many things. Not at the same time, but I still want to practice my tap dancing, learn tango, improve my blues dancing, travel, meditate, do yoga, go swimming, improving my Spanish and so on.

Learning any skill takes time. Especially if you decide to do something like tap dancing or tango. That means training regularly. Of course it’s impossible to fit all that into one day.
So I tend to over-plan my days and take my TODO list way too seriously. And consequently way too often losing the present moment, as it’s “just one of the items on the list and look, there are 10 more to go”.
And I love to invent schedules. Wake up, meditate, do this, train that, work session, lunch, siesta, another work session, another meditation … swimming on Wednesdays, sacrificing a kitten on a full moon or whatever …

So now I’m trying an alternative approach based on time framing, present-moment decisions and awareness of activities I want to do, but I haven’t done in a while.

It sounds a tad fancy, but it’s really very straightforward: time framing is to clearly distinguish between work time and me time and also to put limits on usage of certain things, namely internet-connected devices.
