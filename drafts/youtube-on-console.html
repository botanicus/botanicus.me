<h2>MPS YouTube</h2>
<pre>brew install mps-youtube</pre>
<p>
  Sometimes I just want to play songs from YouTube and this is where MPS YouTube
  player comes in. It let's me do just that without loading YouTube and their damn
  ads from my console.
</p>

<p>
  It can be installed from Homebrew running <code>brew install mps-youtube</code>
  and launched by <code>mpsyt</code>.
</p>

<p>
  From there you can search <code>.search term</code> .....
</p>
