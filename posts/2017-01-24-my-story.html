<p>
  I was born in a small town in Czech Republic.
  It didn't occur to me that I might chose to move abroad until I was 17.
  This simply wasn't what people around me did.
  Since the <abbr title="Czechoslovakia at the time.">Czech Republic</abbr> was part of the socialist block,
  my parents generation weren't allowed to travel quite so freely.
</p>

<p>
  Yet, I ended up moving to London when I was 19, later on to Barcelona, eventually becoming fully nomadic.
</p>

<p>
  It's been a while and I've done many things I'm proud of since then,
  but I still take it as one of my biggest achievements, one that prepared
  the ground for the ones that followed.
</p>

<p>
  How did it happen? I had the right mix of luck and naivity. Plentiful of both.
</p>

<p>
  With a significant contribution from my parents, I bought my first notebook.
  Being a curious type, I started to play around with the system and learn about it.
</p>

<p>
  Shortly I was running on Linux and in a few months I got a job in IT, writing
  articles for then the second biggest Linux portal in Czech Republic. I was 18.
  Suddenly I was making a decent sum of money.
</p>

<p>
  I moved to Prague and eventually I ended up dropping out of my secondary school.
  I was never a fan of the formal education system (and, to the displease of my
  teachers, was pretty vocal about it).
</p>

<p>
  About that time I decided to quit my writing job. I liked it a lot, but I knew
  that what I really wanted to do was to <em>write software</em>[1].
  The creative part of making something out of nothing deeply fascinated me.
  I learnt programming language called Ruby by myself. Learning programming wasn't quite so easy,
  but not terribly difficult either.
</p>

<!-- <p>
  Despite the fact that everyone was foretelling me that I'll end up washing
  dishes in MC Donalds's,
</p> -->

<p>
  What was more challenging was English. My English was nearly non-existent and
  there were very few articles about Ruby in Czech. So I was reading the official
  Ruby documentation with a dictionary. Every paragraph took me probably 20 minutes
  and after one page, my brain was ready to retire.
</p>

<p>
  But I got there. And then I went to Ostrava on Rails, the first Czech Ruby on
  Rails conference. I didn't know anything about Ruby on Rails at that time. And
  there were people from abroad, presenting in English. And they all had this
  beatiful Macs. I remember it like yesterday. Tobias talking about developing
  Shopify in Ruby on Rails.
</p>

<p>
  It was clear to me, this is how you go from an enthusiast who writes jabber bots
  after (well, ehmm, instead of ...) school to someone who works in the industry.
</p>

<p>
  And I was lucky. I met a few guys from Poland who were looking for new devs.
</p>

<p>
  I registered as self-employed and got to work.
</p>

<p>
  But it wasn't that straightforward. OK, terrible SVN I was able to manage to learn,
  but learning to scale images on the front-end, send the values to the back-end and
  crop them there, that was a totally different story.
</p>

<p>
  I was learning, but the web is wide. And the rent has to be paid. Oh boy the rent.
</p>

<p>
  My landlord didn't show much of sympathy to my worthwhile pursuit of learning
  to scale images in JavaScript and I was on the street before you can say AJAX.
</p>

<p>
  Fortunately I had a girlfriend, so I crashed <abbr title="And by that I mean her parents place.">at hers</abbr>
  for a while.
</p>

<p>
  At the end I returned to my parents. You can imagine how happy they were to see me.
  Formal education is something that is taken very, very seriously back home.
  Oh and did I mention my mum's a teacher? Yep.
</p>

<p>
  The following few months were definitely low point of my life. Everyone would
  constantly remind me of what a loser they think I was. My parents saved some money for my studies.
  Since their definition of studying didn't encompass self-learning, so of course I haven't seen a penny.
  And my mum, probably as a gesture of goodwill told me that I have to pay rent. Thanks ma.
</p>

<p>
  Projects were coming in slowly and I learnt the hard way that just because a price
  is agreed upon and the invoice is send doesn't mean anything. This experience repeated itself,
  so I decided to concentrate more on clients from abroad and also to charge a downpayment.
</p>

<p>
  This lasted for nearly a year, but my luck finally turned. One of my friends
  from the Ruby meet-ups moved to London. He was using web framework called Merb.
  So was I. In Europe at the time it was very rare, so when he needed some help with testing,
  his company hired me to help him.
</p>

<p>
  How do I get to the airport? Bus 119, OK. Oh wow, I'm flying, how cool is that!
</p>

<p>
  And then London. Wow. That was like from the future. I was in love. Lights on
  the Big Ben. Walks on the south bank. Taking a double-decker. Wicked!
</p>

<p>
  After I returned, I told my girlfriend I want to live in London. I didn't go down very well.
</p>

<p>
  Two months past and I got a message from my friend in London. His flat-mate is
  moving out and he's on a look-out for a new one.
</p>

<p>
  Bags packed. Flight ticket booked. London, here I go!
</p>

<p>
  Moving from a cheap country to an expensive country is not easy. One sandwich
  from Pret a Manger costed same money as a family dinner in an expensive restaurant back home.
</p>

<p>
  I had only money for the first rent and for food for the first month.
</p>

<p>
  But was I supposed to walk away on a chance like that? Fuck no!
</p>

<p>
  So here I was, for the first time in my life actually actively trying to get a job.
  Browsing job boards, applying and even getting some interviews. Boring. And watching
  episodes of Dexter in between.
</p>

<p>
  I went a meetup of <abbr title="London Ruby user group">LRUG</abbr> and I met
  some guys who were looking for developers. They said they have a legacy project
  in Rails. I said cool, sounds interesting. I had no clue what legacy means.
</p>

<p>
  So the next day I went to an interview and despite not understanding
  half of the questions I was asked, I got the job. After I started, I learnt
  the meaning of the word legacy.
</p>

<p>
  Oh boy, what a piece of $@#%%#!!! the app was. And to my huge shock, despite my
  lack of real-world experience, I was the best developer in there.
</p>

<p>
  At least they had drinks every Friday and a good English breakfast place nearby.
  Thanks God for that.
</p>

<!-- JGP party. -->

<p>
  I lasted about 8 months. After one more try on being a permanent employee, I
  decided to go freelance again. I just need my freedom.
</p>

<p>
  I got a contract in the RabbitMQ team of VMware. The Ruby AMQP library was broken
  and they needed someone to maintain it. AMQwhat? Oh so it's like the e-mail, but for apps.
  Got it. Sure, I'll do it.
</p>

<p>
  I loved working for VMware and I'm proud of what happened with Ruby AMQP during that time.
</p>

<p>
  It wasn't easy. Parsing a binary protocol wasn't anything I have ever done. I gave
  some talks on conferences as well, some good, some pretty terrible ones. But they
  gave me freedom to work on whatever I wanted, so I tried to do my best.
</p>

<p>
  I stayed with them for a while, until they made cuts and me and the other contractor was made redundant.
  C'est la vie.
</p>

<p>
  I was dating a girl at that time and I was getting worried that I actually really
  care about her. Oh crap. What do I do? Hmm, how about going to Japan for a while?
  Besides, I want to travel and I always wanted to see Japan.
</p>

<p>
  Flight tickets booked, konichiva here we go!
</p>

<!-- (LSD), dodavka. -->

<p>
  We tried to break up. Unsuccessfully. Wow, so it's like serious for real now? Holy shit!
</p>

<p>
  I enjoyed my two months in Asia and returned back to London to my girl.
  There was a lot of breaking up, making up, crying and fucking.
</p>

<!-- wasn't ready -->

<p>
  But one day we broke up for real. I said oh well, let's change the view, how
  about a road-trip?
</p>

<p>
  I drove with my friend across Belgium, Netherlands and Germany in my van.
  For the ten days I was with him, I didn't quite sink in what a terrible, terrible
  mistake that was, letting her go.
</p>

<p>
  But than again, what could have I do? I just wasn't ready. I was 24. I wanted
  to have fun with more girls. It wasn't time to settle down. How is it with
  a black woman? I didn't know, but I wanted to find out.
</p>

<p>
  Looking back, of course it wasn't worth it, not in milion years. I had fun with
  all kind of girls, but every night when I close my eyes, to this day, I see her,
  my little princess from China, I can smell her hair, see her smile and I just
  wonder what the hell was I thinking.

<hr />

<p>
  In February 2015 I moved back to London.
</p>

<p>
  I realised that I spend all my weekends going to dance festivals and so in May 2016,
  I decided to go fully nomadic again. I gave up my flat in London, packed my bag,
  and off I went.
</p>

<p>
  Going nomadic is becoming more and more common. I tried it before, but it's hard.
  Especially being in a country where you don't understand the language, with no friends,
  it's hard. Even if you stay there for a year or longer.
</p>

<p>
  With dancing though, it's different[2]. When I'm in Europe, I meet the same people
  all the time, so even though I'm moving from country to country, it doesn't feel like it.
  Plus, thanks to EasyJet, the flight tickets are really cheap.
</p>

<p>
  At the end, I'm glad I was brought up in a peaceful country with a different perspective on life.
  When I was younger, I used to think that moving to a Western country would make my life better,
  but it's just not so straightforward. Czech Republic has many problems and so does the UK.
  I'm glad I had the opportunity to experience it.
</p>

<p>
  And so the story continues ...
</p>

<hr />
<p>
  [1] Since then my views changed, having explored both, I now enjoy writing and
      educating as much (if not more) than creating. I've been in IT for a long
      time and I feel that mentoring is the best use of my time.
</p>

<p>
  [2] Every dance community is different. The swing community is not as big as for instance salsa,
      so it has much more of a family-like feeling and blues even more so.
